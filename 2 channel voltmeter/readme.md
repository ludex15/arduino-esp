## 2 channel voltmeter using arduino analog pins

Electronic parts: 2 LEDs, buzzer, I2C bus, LCD display, resistors for LEDs and buttons, buttons

The voltage is measured from arduino itself. 
One is steady 3.3V and the other one goes from potentiometer middle pin to "recreate" different voltages. 
The result of measuring is displayed on LCD using I2C bus.

By pressing buttons you can choose between 1. channel and 2. channel, or simultaneously without delays between measuring.
There is a little bit of beep sound from buzzer when any button is pressed.

!!Only 2 buttons are used in code!!

If you have any questions, please contact me I will be glad to help.

Open-source project.
